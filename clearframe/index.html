      <h2>What Clearframe is</h2>
      <p>Clearframe designs and installs simple websites for people who care more about clarity than noise. No funnels. No bloat. No optimization theater.</p>
      <p>Just structure that holds meaning.</p>

      <h2>If you already have a site</h2>
      <p>Clearframe can restructure what exists. This is not a redesign. It is a correction.</p>
      <p>This includes reorganizing content so it reads in the right order, reducing cognitive load, removing redundancy and ambiguity, and clarifying what matters and what does not.</p>

      <h2>If you don’t have a site yet</h2>
      <p>Clearframe installs a proven one-page structure and populates it with only what is necessary. You are not starting from a blank canvas. You are starting from a known, stable frame.</p>
      <p>This keeps cost, time, and complexity low—while avoiding future rework.</p>

      <h2>What you receive</h2>
      <p>A complete static website. Clean HTML and CSS. No platform lock-in. No maintenance dependency.</p>
      <p>Sites are compatible with GitHub Pages and similar static hosting. You receive something you can keep.</p>

      <h2>What Clearframe is not</h2>
      <p>Clearframe is not a marketing agency, a growth service, a funnel builder, or a content mill.</p>
      <p>If you are optimizing for engagement, this is not the right tool. If you are optimizing for understanding, it is.</p>
